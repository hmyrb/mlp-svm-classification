# MLP & SVM Classification Project

This project focuses on implementing and comparing Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for classification tasks.

## Objectives
- Implement MLP and SVM models in Python
- Perform data preprocessing and normalization
- Tune model parameters
- Evaluate performance using accuracy and loss metrics
- Compare different algorithms

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Results
The models were evaluated using validation datasets, and their performances were analyzed based on classification accuracy and convergence behavior. The results is given in a report file.
