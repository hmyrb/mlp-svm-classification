# MLP, SVM & Hybrid Classification Project

This project focuses on implementing, comparing, and combining Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for classification tasks.

## Objectives
- Implement MLP and SVM models in Python
- Develop a hybrid classification model by combining multiple algorithms
- Perform data preprocessing and normalization
- Tune model parameters
- Evaluate performance using accuracy and loss metrics
- Compare different algorithms and hybrid approaches

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Methods
This project includes:
- Standalone MLP and SVM models
- A hybrid classification approach integrating multiple models
- Performance evaluation using cross-validation and metric comparison

## Results
The models were evaluated using validation datasets. The hybrid approach demonstrated improved stability and classification performance compared to individual models in selected scenarios.
